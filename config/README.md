# Config Directory

This folder is intended for global configuration files for the monorepo, such as Nginx, environment, or other shared service configs.

- Place all global config files here (e.g., `nginx.conf`, `redis.conf`, etc.).
- Update Docker Compose or service definitions to mount configs from this directory.
